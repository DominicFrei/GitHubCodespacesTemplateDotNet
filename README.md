# GrittR

GrittR is a self-hosted and open-source social media management application designed to help users manage and schedule their social media posts. With GrittR, users can easily schedule and manage their posts, view analytics, and bill users through the Stripe API. The application allows users to post to Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok, and it includes a queue for scheduled posts, a section for previous posts and post management, and a scheduler for bulk content creation scheduled in the future. The application also supports importing from CSV, XLS, and common file formats and posting automatically from RSS feeds. GrittR is built using .NET for the backend and appropriate technologies in C# for the frontend.

Features:

- Configure social media accounts locally or through the UI
- Two-factor authentication with email or Google Authenticator
- Post to Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok
- CLI and appropriate frontend for publishing to social media pages
- Queue for scheduled posts and post management
- Section for previous posts and post management (removal or reposting)
- Draft version of posts that won't be published until set to do so
- Scheduler for bulk content creation scheduled in the future
- Import from CSV, XLS, and common file formats
- Posting automatically from RSS feeds and managing which accounts to use
- Calendar view and modification of the schedule
- Analytics for all posts including optimal times and best posts

## Billing

Billing will be handled through the Stripe API. Users can sign up for a subscription plan and be billed monthly. The subscription plan will include a set number of social media accounts, scheduled posts, and analytics features. Additional features can be purchased as add-ons.
Design:

The design of the application will be simple and intuitive. The application will be built using .NET for the backend and appropriate technologies in C# for the frontend. The application will consist of two components: a CLI for publishing and scheduling posts from the command line and a web UI for managing social media accounts, scheduling posts, and viewing analytics.

## Backend

The backend will be built using .NET, a popular framework for building web applications. The backend will consist of several components:

- User authentication and account management
- Social media account management
- Post scheduling and management
- Analytics tracking and reporting
- Stripe integration for billing and subscription management

## Frontend

The frontend will be built using appropriate technologies in C#, a powerful and flexible programming language for building web applications. The frontend will consist of two components:
CLI for publishing and scheduling posts from the command line
Web UI for managing social media accounts, scheduling posts, and viewing analytics
Database:

The application will use a NoSQL database for storing user data, social media accounts, and scheduled posts.

## Deployment

The application can be deployed to a cloud platform such as AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean. It can also be deployed on a self-hosted server or a VPS.

## REST API

GrittR's REST API allows you to access the backend through HTTP requests without the need for an SDK. Each endpoint in the API represents a specific operation on a specific resource. The REST API is authenticated with API keys instead of account sessions, and JWT authentication is used for server applications to act on behalf of a user.
Query Methods: The API will provide query methods to filter and sort data in the database.
